# React-Vs-Html-code
Comparing writing pages for web apps using react and html. The example (i.e index1.html and index.jsx) used it to create a navigation bar.

**Differences:**
### Key Differences

1. **Syntax Differences:**
   - **HTML:** Uses standard HTML syntax with tags and attributes. Itâ€™s static and cannot embed JavaScript expressions directly.
   - **JSX:** JavaScript XML syntax used within React. Curly braces `{}` are used to embed JavaScript expressions.

2. **Dynamic Content:**
   - **HTML:** To insert dynamic content, you might use templating languages or server-side rendering techniques (e.g., `{{ user.username }}`).
   - **JSX:** You directly embed JavaScript expressions using curly braces `{}`, such as `{user.username}`.

3. **Routing:**
   - **HTML:** Uses standard `<a>` tags with `href` attributes for navigation.
   - **JSX:** Uses React Router's `<Link>` component for client-side routing. This is more efficient in single-page applications (SPAs) as it avoids full-page reloads.

4. **Component Structure:**
   - **HTML:** Represents a static structure and is generally part of the HTML markup that could be reused across pages.
   - **JSX:** Encapsulates a reusable component. The component can be imported and used across different parts of a React application.

5. **Import Statements:**
   - **HTML:** Does not include JavaScript import statements.
   - **JSX:** Includes `import` statements to bring in React, components, or libraries.

6. **Attributes:**
   - **HTML:** Uses standard HTML attributes like `class`, `href`, etc.
   - **JSX:** Uses `className` instead of `class` to avoid conflicts with JavaScript's `class` keyword. Attributes are camelCased in JSX (e.g., `className`).

7. **Dynamic Rendering:**
   - **HTML:** Requires server-side logic or JavaScript to modify the page dynamically.
   - **JSX:** React's state and props can dynamically render content without needing to refresh or reload the page.

In summary, JSX is a more dynamic and integrated approach for building user interfaces in React applications, allowing for direct embedding of JavaScript and React-specific functionalities, whereas HTML is static and used in traditional web development contexts.
